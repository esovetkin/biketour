# biketour - plan your bike trip

This tool allows to choose a perfect day to go for a long bike trip.

## ToDO features:

 + [DONE] query historical weather database

   for a given route create and populate database with weather
   historical records along the journey

 + [DONE] physical model based on a constant power output

   Implement a physical model that assumes that a cyclist cycles with
   a constant power. This model takes into account wind, temperature,
   pressure, humidity, climbs, efficiency of drive_train, etc

 + [DONE] compute a trip plan

   The trip plan is computed using a physical model

 + [DONE] compute plan characteristics for different data

 + estimate physical model parameters using the travel data

   yet to be implemented: the travel data should include power-meter
   measurements as well as gps coordinates, time and elevation

 + compute how good the next days forecast for taking the journey

 + graphs, plots
